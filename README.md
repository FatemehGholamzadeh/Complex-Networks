# Complex-Networks

assignments and project of Complex Networks Course at AUT under supervision of Prof. Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani.
the assignments consist of following:
•	computation clustering coefficient and plotting degree distribution for Facebook graph.
•	Implementation of Influence Maximization algorithms and finding optimal set for outbreak detection in Facebook dataset.
•	Implementation of Spectral Clustering and computing min cut and modularity criterion.
•	Link prediction and reporting precision and recall criterion.

Final Project of this Course is about:
•	Work with Graph Attention Networks (GATconv and GATv2conv of PyG library) on Citeseer, Cora and PubMed datasets. 
•	modifying concatenation part and testing different number of heads.
